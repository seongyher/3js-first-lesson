    <h1>Dangle Dongle's Log...</h1>
    <p>A ship approaches through the fog and a hearty cheer rings out through the great hall. For too long the forge has been silent, but with these latest riches from the Black Forest the air shall once more be filled with the ringing of hammers and stench of soot and Nordic sweat. The three sailors are welcomed with... A solemn hush falls, as not three, but one single figure steps off, head turned down.</p>
    <p>Scene cuts indoors, drinking mead around the fire as a storm rages outside.</p>
    <p>"Ay, this wealth of ore is soaked in the blood of Vic and Fjord, but know this, all of you, know that they died in true battle. Hear me and know it's no falsehood when I say the battle began when a mighty sea serpent attacked us in the newly discovered channel. Fjord wasted no time, val-heim-iantly driving the ship aground with the salty beast hot on our trail.</p>
    <p>For you see, it was not the serpent that killed them... There was a fiendish troll, waiting with a mighty oak in its hands the same way I wield this axe... The battle went on for hours, defending the ship from land and from sea, not to mention the skeletons. Did I mention the skeletons? Ay, there was a crypt spewing the undead monstrosities into this surprisingly diverse battle.</p> 
    <p>So melt down this copper and tin, but put aside some bars for a fermenter, use that fermenter to make some mead, tip that mead out in their honour, for we shall never see their faces again.</p>
    <p>Lightning strikes nearby, the windows flash bright, as the door slams open, two figures silhouetted against the torrential rain behind them. The only sound is their heavy footsteps as they tread towards the table, upending a bag and tipping eight surtling cores onto it.</p>
    <p>"What, Dangle, you thought us dead? Not when there's loot like this to be had!"</p>
